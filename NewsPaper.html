        <hr>
        <div class="byline"><center>By JAMES R. ELLIOTT | Washington Bureau</center></div>
        <br>
        <p><b>WASHINGTON - President Johnson unveiled an ambitious $2 trillion climate change plan
            yesterday that would transform the nation's energy infrastructure over the next decade, calling
            it "the most significant investment in our planet's future since the moon landing."</b></p>
        <br>
        <p>The proposal, dubbed the "Green New Horizon," would create millions of jobs while rapidly
            accelerating the transition to renewable energy sources. Key components include: </p>
        
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 60px;line-height: 1.5">
          <li>Complete decarbonization of the power grid by 2035</li>
          <li>Tax incentives for electric vehicle adoption</li>
          <li>Modernization of public transportation systems</li>
          <li>Funding for climate resilience projects</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p  style="border-left: 3px solid darkred;

        color: darkred;
        font-style: italic;
        font-family: Georgia, serif;
        font-size: 20px;"> 
        "This isn't just about saving the planet for future generations—it's about creating good jobs
        right now for American workers," the President said during his Rose Garden announcement.."
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Republican leaders immediately criticized the plan as too expensive and government-heavy.
            Senate Minority Leader Mark Richardson (R-KY) called it "a socialist wish list that will cripple
            our economy."
        </p>
        
        <P>Meanwhile, environmental groups praised the initiative while urging even more aggressive
            action. "This is a good start, but the science demands we move faster," said Sierra Club
            executive director Maya Chen.</P>
        <br>
         <div class="headline" style="color: rgb(133, 9, 9);"> Local Impact</div>
         <p>For New Yorkers, the plan would mean significant upgrades to subway infrastructure,
            expanded bike lanes, and new job training programs in green energy sectors. Mayor Williams
            hailed the proposal as "exactly what cities need to combat climate change while rebuilding
            our middle class."</p>

        <p><b>SAN FRANCISCO -</b> NeuroTech Inc. yesterday demonstrated what it calls "the world's first

            intelligence, and creative problem-solving beyond current AI systems.</p>

          <li>The longest game in opening day history (4 hours, 38 minutes)</li>
        </ul>
